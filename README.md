<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsI8hJmggI) ###place holder

<h2>Description</h2>
in this lab I'll teach you how to utilize Oracle Virtual Box to create an Active Directory home lab setup in this video. Setting up and running this lab will undoubtedly help you learn more about active directory and Windows networking. I'd recommend going through it a few times, asking questions when anything is unclear, and finally attempting to build it without watching. Please let me know if you have any queries!
